# Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze employee attrition patterns and identify key factors contributing to employee turnover. This interactive Power BI dashboard provides insights into the relationship between attrition and variables like salary, age, job role, education, and work experience.

# Key Questions & KPIs
## Key Questions:
- How does salary and job role influence employee attrition?
- What is the attrition rate across different age groups?
- Is there a relationship between work experience and attrition?
- How does education level impact attrition?
- Which job roles experience the highest employee attrition?
## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- Total Employee Count
- Total Attrition Count
- Attrition Rate
- Average Age
- Average Salary
- Average Years at Company

# Process of the Project
## Data Collection:
Dataset used: <a href = "https://github.com/AkashKumar-47/HR-Analytics/blob/main/HR_Analytics.csv">HR_Analytics</a> 
## Data Cleaning & Transformation:
- Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
- Ensured proper data types for each field (e.g., numerical, categorical).
- Created calculated measures: 
  - Attrition Rate = (Total Attrition / Total Employees) * 100
  - Average Age
  - Average Salary
  - Average Years at Company
## Dashboard Creation:
- Built interactive visualizations using Power BI: 
  - Attrition by Salary and Job Role (Stacked Bar Chart)
  - Attrition by Age (Stacked Column Chart)
  - Attrition by Experience (Area Chart)
  - Attrition by Education (Donut Chart)
  - Attrition Count by Job Role (Matrix)
  - Key Metrics (Cards for Total Employees, Total Attrition, Attrition Rate, Average Age, Average Salary, and Average Years)
- Added interactive slicers for Department and Gender to enable dynamic exploration.

# Project Insights
## Salary and Job Role Impact: 
- Employees with lower salaries show higher attrition, particularly in certain job roles.
## Age and Attrition: 
- Younger employees (in their 20s and early 30s) show a higher attrition rate compared to older employees.
## Experience and Attrition: 
- Employees with fewer years of experience at the company are more likely to leave.
## Education and Attrition: 
- Certain education levels, particularly lower levels, have a higher attrition rate.
## Job Role Analysis: 
- Specific job roles (e.g., Sales and Technical roles) exhibit the highest attrition counts.

## Final Conclusion
- The Power BI dashboard effectively visualizes key attrition drivers, providing actionable insights for HR teams to address employee turnover. The analysis highlights the influence of salary, age, and job roles on attrition while enabling stakeholders to drill down by department and gender.
- By monitoring these trends, HR departments can make data-driven decisions to reduce attrition and improve employee retention strategies.
